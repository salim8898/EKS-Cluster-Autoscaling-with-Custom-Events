# ðŸš€ AutoScaler for Amazon EKS

This project demonstrates how to automatically scale an Amazon EKS cluster based on custom events using AWS Lambda, EventBridge, and AWS SAM. By monitoring custom metrics and adjusting the desired node count of the EKS cluster, this solution enables seamless scaling to handle varying workload demands.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd auto-scaler-for-eks
   ```

3. Deploy the Lambda function using AWS SAM CLI:
   ```bash
   sam deploy --guided --parameter-overrides Python/lambda_function.py
   ```

4. Follow the instructions provided by AWS SAM CLI to configure the deployment.

5. Once the deployment is complete, the Lambda function will be triggered automatically based on EKS cluster events.

## Benefits

- **Automatic Scaling**: The Lambda function monitors custom metrics and dynamically adjusts the desired node count of the EKS cluster based on workload demands, ensuring optimal resource allocation.

- **Cost Optimization**: By scaling the cluster up or down as needed, this solution helps optimize costs by aligning resource usage with actual workload requirements.

- **Efficient Resource Management**: With automatic scaling, you can ensure that your EKS cluster is always right-sized, providing the necessary resources to handle varying workloads effectively.

- **Simplified Operations**: This solution automates the scaling process, reducing the need for manual intervention and simplifying cluster management.

- **Flexible Customization**: The project can be customized to monitor specific custom metrics and implement scaling strategies tailored to your application's requirements.

## Services Used

This project leverages several AWS services to deploy and automate the scaling of an Amazon EKS cluster. Here's an overview of the key services used:

- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute service used to execute the scaling logic based on custom events from the EKS cluster.
- **AWS SAM**: Framework for building serverless applications used to define and deploy the Lambda function as an AWS Serverless Application.
- **Amazon EKS**: Managed Kubernetes service used to run and manage the EKS cluster, integrating with the scaling solution.
- **Amazon EventBridge**: Serverless event bus service used to capture custom events from the EKS cluster and trigger the Lambda function.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitoring and observability service used to collect and store custom metric data from the EKS cluster.

These services work together to create an automated and scalable solution for managing an Amazon EKS cluster. By combining the power of serverless computing, event-driven architecture, and Kubernetes orchestration, this project enables efficient and cost-effective scaling of EKS clusters based on custom events and metrics.
